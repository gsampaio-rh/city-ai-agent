# City AI Agent

City AI Agent is an end‚Äëto‚Äëend municipal infrastructure intelligence platform that detects, analyzes, and summarizes road hazards‚Äîspecifically potholes‚Äîfor city maintenance teams. Leveraging state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart computer vision, geospatial data, and local large language model inference, this tool empowers cities with actionable, context‚Äërich insights in Brazilian Portuguese.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real‚ÄëTime Pothole Detection:**  
  Utilizes a custom‚Äëtrained YOLOv8 model for on‚Äëthe‚Äëfly detection of potholes from road images.
  
- **Geospatial Enrichment:**  
  Integrates with public geocoding (Nominatim) and Overpass APIs to extract location data, nearby amenities, and critical infrastructure information.
  
- **Multimodal AI Summarization:**  
  Uses LLaMA via Ollama for generating clean, context‚Äëaware summaries. The optional captioning module can supply supplementary visual context but is no longer required.
  
- **Interactive UI:**  
  Built in Streamlit and enhanced with Folium maps, the interface presents detection results, geospatial data, and AI‚Äëgenerated summaries in clear, step‚Äëwise panels.

- **Modular, Scalable Architecture:**  
  Business logic is fully separated into dedicated service modules so that the presentation layer remains 100% UI‚Äëfocused.

## üß† AI Stack Overview

### YOLOv8 Detection

- **Function:** Locates potholes and computes severity based on bounding box metrics.
- **Usage:** The detection service processes uploaded road images and annotates pothole locations.

### LLM Summarization with LLaMA via Ollama

- **Models:**
  - `llama3.2:3b` for text‚Äëonly summary generation.
  - `llama3.2-vision` for multimodal insights when required.
- **How It Works:**  
  Combines geospatial data, visual detection results, and (optionally) image captions (if provided) to generate concise, context‚Äërich summaries in 100% BR‚ÄëPortuguese.
- **Note:** Captioning is now optional, allowing a more streamlined workflow if desired.

## üåê API Integrations Overview

City AI Agent relies on three powerful, open-access APIs that make up the geospatial intelligence layer:

### 1. OpenStreetMap (OSM)

- **What it is:**  
  A collaborative, open-source map of the world, built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, buildings, infrastructure, and more.
  
- **Usage in this project:**  
  - OSM provides the base data used by both the Nominatim and Overpass APIs.
  - All geospatial queries and results are ultimately derived from OSM data.
  - OSM‚Äôs structure allows for rich metadata tagging (e.g., surface type, max speed, amenity types) that is leveraged in road analysis.

> üåê Website: https://www.openstreetmap.org/

### 2. Nominatim API

- **What it is:**  
  A geocoding and reverse geocoding service that uses OpenStreetMap data.

- **Endpoints used:**
  - **Forward geocoding:** Convert textual addresses to latitude/longitude.
  - **Reverse geocoding:** Convert coordinates into human-readable addresses and context.

- **Example in City AI Agent:**
  - Identify the exact address or road name where a pothole is located.
  - Determine neighborhood or administrative boundaries for reporting.

```python
# Example use (from geo.py):
lat, lon, display_name = forward_geocode("Av. Paulista, S√£o Paulo, Brazil")
```

> üìò API Docs: https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/api/Overview/

### 3. Overpass API

- **What it is:**  
  A query API that allows custom searches against the OpenStreetMap dataset using Overpass QL (query language).

- **Used for:**
  - Searching for amenities (schools, hospitals, etc.) near detected potholes.
  - Analyzing infrastructure metadata like road types, surface quality, number of lanes, and speed limits.
  - Filtering specific tags (e.g., "highway", "amenity", "surface") in a geographic radius.

- **Example in City AI Agent:**
  - Fetch traffic-related attributes for nearby roads.
  - Visualize surrounding context for hazard prioritization.

```overpassql
[out:json];
way(around:100, -23.561, -46.656)["highway"];
out body;
```

> üìì API Docs: https://overpass-api.de/

### Optional BLIP Captioning

- **Function:** Generates image captions to complement detection data.
- **Status:** Available as a service module but no longer mandatory within the AI pipeline.

---

## üíª User Interface

- **Framework:** Streamlit  
  The UI orchestrates the processing steps‚Äîimage upload, detection, geospatial enrichment, and AI summarization‚Äîwhile business logic is abstracted in the `services/` modules.
- **Mapping:** Folium is used to visualize pothole locations and nearby facilities on an interactive map.
